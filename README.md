T.E.S.S.A
Traditional Electronic Shower System Application (v2)
=====

// Unity3D example of T.E.S.S.A design for H.C.I. class.

// Buildout uses a preplanned guided talking script to showcase how it could work(see 'text' folder.

// v1 was a research essay into the design of a prototype with humanistic characteristics (+HCD), v2 is the simulated experience.

Brief:
=====
Tessa is designed is to help assist, personalize, speed-up and automate the traditional asian ‘bathhouse’ experience; that is rapidly becoming lost due to modernization within the countries as well differing ideologies. Culturally speaking, one would visit weekly with family not only for bathing needs but also for the “experience” of being washed with personal attention given. An attentive traditional spanning years of routine. - The goal of this being a seamless experience from introduction to Tessa, to entrance of shower, to exit of bathhouse.

Setup:
=====
Upon entering the bathhouse’s open shower or private room, Tessa would greet the user and start a preliminary setup for the user based on language, hight, shape, posture, sex, age and spacial needs (massage style, soap option, scented additives, etc). Much of this would be gathered automatically by use of laser range-finders, imbedded scale, voice depth detection and so fourth. No backscatter or IR cameras would be used, to preserve privacy.
