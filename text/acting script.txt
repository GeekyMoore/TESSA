I’m Brenden and English please.

Move into NEW audioTrigger

Action2:
Can Do Brenden! Have you been here before? I can look up your account via your telephone number.

Self:
I have not.

Move into NEW audioTrigger

Action3:
Not a problem Brenden! It’s really simple and I think you’ll find the benefits of a traditional Chinese shower without the need for a partner quite nice.

Let me explain how I work:

-Please approach the red box you see ahead of you. We’ll run a quick weight check.
-Next I’ll use my laser range-finders to get a height and base-shape check.
-Next I’m going to use my lasers to check your posture; should any part of you be hurting please tell me.
-At anytime you can further edit your experience by using my touch-screen you see to the left of the shower.

Move into NEW audioTrigger ON RED BOX

Action4:
Starting scan... and done. I noticed your lower back could use some extra attention today... Beginning shower :)

Self leaves red box, shower ends.

Action5:
Thanks for visiting today Brenden. Could I get your phone number to save you an account?

Self stops moving

Self:
Maybe next time Tessa.

Self moves to cookies

Action6:
No problem Brenden! Feel free to take a fortune cookie on your way out. (Say goodbye and have a wonderful day, in Chinese now).

Self walks out door, - End demonstration.
